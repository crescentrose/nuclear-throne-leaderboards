        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        <p>I'd like to thank you for helping out. You have donated <b>$32</b>, which ensures stable operation of the site for
          at least three months, after which my financial situation should be good enough for me to support the site as I did until now.
        </p>
        <p>As I promised, I'm providing evidence of funds received and funds transferred to my host <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IcLdGo2.png">here</a>.
        Prior to the donation plea, I've had $1.95 in my PayPal account. You've donated $32. Paypal took $3.34 in fees, which leaves
        <b>$30.61</b> total available. I've transferred $30 to the host, and I don't know what to do with 61 cents. </p>
        <p>Now that we got the business out of the way, I'd like to sincerely thank everyone who donated. You are the real MVPs. In the
          next few days I'll make it worth your while... hopefully!</p>
        <p>Thanks again,</p>
        <p>--Darwin</p>
